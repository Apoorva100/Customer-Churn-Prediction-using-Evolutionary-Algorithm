# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Shallow-Feedforward-Neural-Network-Model
Expertise in predicting customer churn using machine learning, to develop a balanced shallow feedforward neural network model resulting in the creation of retention campaigns and loyalty programs to retain customers. 
Demonstrated proficiency in evaluating model performance by plotting the average accuracy for both training and test data, and displaying confusion matrices separately for both sets.
